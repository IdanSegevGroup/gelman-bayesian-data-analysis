These are just personal notes that I am taking whilst reading and learning from
the book "Bayesian Data Analysis" by Gelman, Carlin, Stern, and Rubin.

The [homepage for the book is here](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/book/).
It includes solutions to some exercises.                               

The notes are not specifically intended for general consumption and I make no
claims to accuracy.
