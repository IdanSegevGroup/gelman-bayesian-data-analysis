> Predictive distributions: let $y$ be the number of 6's in 1000 rolls of a fair die.
>
> 1. Sketch the approximate distriution of $y$, based on the normal approximation.
> 2. Using the normal distribution table, give approximate 5%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 95% points for the distribution of $y$.


# Calculate Mean and standard deviation
```{r}
n <- 1000
p <- 1/6

E_y <- n * p
var_y <- n * p * (1 - p)
sd_y <- sqrt(var_y)
```

# Sketch the normal approximation
```{r}
curve(dnorm(x, E_y, sd_y), E_y-4*sd_y, E_y+4*sd_y)
```

# Give approximate percentiles based on normal approximation
```{r}
percentiles <- c(.05, .25, .5, .75, .95)
curve(dnorm(x, E_y, sd_y), E_y-4*sd_y, E_y+4*sd_y)
(quantiles <- qnorm(percentiles, E_y, sd_y))
abline(v=quantiles, lty=2)
```
